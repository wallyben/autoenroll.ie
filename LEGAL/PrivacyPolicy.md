# Privacy Policy

AutoEnroll.ie processes payroll validation data strictly as a processor on behalf of employers and bureaux. We minimise data collection, hash identifiers, and avoid retaining raw payroll files by default.

## Data Collected
- Account: email, organisation details, subscription status.
- Payroll uploads: hashed identifiers, derived age bands, eligibility outcomes, validation issues.
- Billing: Stripe customer and subscription IDs.

## Usage
- Provide validation, eligibility assessment, contribution calculations, and reports.
- Support security monitoring and service performance.
- Deliver billing and account notifications.

## Retention
- Default zero-retention for payroll files; optional short-retention with encryption and explicit customer enablement.
- Account/billing data retained for contract and regulatory requirements.

## Rights
- Access, rectification, deletion, and portability requests honoured via support channels.
- Objection to processing of analytics is supported through organisation settings.

## Security
- TLS enforced; encryption at rest for any retained data; strict access controls; no PII in logs.
